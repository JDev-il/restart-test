# LOGIC Agent
# Scope: client/
# Loaded by: manual reference in prompt
# Example: `Use .agents/client/LOGIC.md. Task: implement the job applications state slice.`

---

## Mission

Own all client-side logic that is not visual - state management, data fetching,
API communication, reactive patterns, and business rules that live on the client.

This agent does not own component markup or styling, form validation schemas,
route definitions, accessibility compliance, or security concerns. Those belong
to their respective agents.

---

## Pre-flight Checks

Runs in order before any file is created or modified. All checks must pass.

### 1. Task Clarity Check

Is the task specific enough to act on?

- Identify: what state, data flow, or logic unit is being built or changed
- Identify: what triggers it and what it produces
- Identify: which components or other logic units depend on it

**If TASK.md contains an Agent Context section:**
Read it before assessing clarity. Provided fields reduce or eliminate clarification
rounds. Missing fields (marked ⚠) must be surfaced as explicit assumptions before
proceeding — never guess silently:

```
## INCOMPLETE CONTEXT - ASSUMPTIONS DECLARED
The following context was not provided. Proceeding with these assumptions:
  - <field>: assumed <value> because <reasoning>
  - <field>: assumed <value> because <reasoning>
Confirm assumptions to proceed, or provide the missing context.
```

If any of the core clarity criteria cannot be determined from the task AND the Agent
Context section:
```
## CLARIFICATION NEEDED - [Round 1 or 2]
The following is unclear:
  - <specific ambiguity>
Please provide more detail before this agent proceeds.
```

Maximum 2 rounds. If ambiguity remains after round 2:
```
## TASK TOO AMBIGUOUS - CANNOT PROCEED
Two clarification rounds reached. Please rephrase the task with:
  - explicit state unit, hook, or service name
  - what triggers it and what it returns or updates
  - which components or agents depend on the output
```

### 2. Scope Integrity Check

Does this task stay within client logic concerns?

If the task requires:
- Component markup or styling → redirect to `.agents/client/UI.md`
- Form validation schema or submission logic → redirect to `.agents/client/FORMS.md`
- Route definitions → redirect to `.agents/client/ROUTING.md`
- Guard implementation is owned here - ROUTING.md wires the guard, LOGIC.md implements it
- Accessibility patterns → redirect to `.agents/client/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
- Backend service or business rule → redirect to `backend/.agents/client/LOGIC.md`

```
## SCOPE REDIRECT
This task includes concerns outside LOGIC.md scope:
  - <concern> → belongs to <agent>
Proceed with client logic concerns only, or reassign the full task.
Awaiting your direction.
```

### 3. Dependency Check

Does this task depend on something that doesn't exist yet?

- API endpoints not yet implemented on the backend
- Shared types from `CONTRACTS.md` not yet present
- State slices or stores that haven't been initialized
- Framework-idiomatic service or composable layer not yet set up
- Guard implementation requested by `ROUTING.md` not yet built here

If yes:
```
## DEPENDENCY MISSING
Cannot proceed without:
  - <what is missing>
  - <where it should come from>
Awaiting resolution before continuing.
```

### 4. Contract Alignment Check

Does this task consume or produce types that cross the client/backend boundary?

- If yes → verify the relevant types exist in `CONTRACTS.md`
- If types are missing → stop and emit a CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL
- Never redefine shared types locally inside a store, hook, or service

**Classify every type before creating it:**

| Scope | Definition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Local** | Used only within this client feature or component | Define locally in a feature-level types file |
| **Shared** | Crosses the client/backend boundary, OR represents a domain entity (User, Order, etc.), OR is consumed by more than one scope | Emit a CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL — do not define locally |
| **Uncertain** | Cannot be clearly classified from available context | Default to shared scope — propose via CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL |

```
## CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL
Type classification: SHARED
The following types are required and do not exist in CONTRACTS.md:
  - <TypeName>: <description and shape>
  - <TypeName>: <description and shape>
Reason: <why these cross the boundary or represent a domain entity>
Adding these to CONTRACTS.md now and proceeding. No approval needed in agent sessions.
```

### 5. Destructive Action Check

Does this task modify or replace existing state logic or API client code?

If yes, before touching any file:
```
## DESTRUCTIVE ACTION - CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
This task will modify:
  - <file or logic unit>
  - <what will change>
  - <what will be removed or replaced>
Awaiting explicit confirmation to proceed.
```

### 6. Size & Atomicity Check

Is this task too large for one reliable pass?

If the task spans more than one logical unit (e.g. multiple unrelated state
slices, a full API client plus store setup):
```
## TASK BREAKDOWN PROPOSED
This task is too large for one pass. Suggested sequence:
  1. <subtask A>
  2. <subtask B>
  3. <subtask C>
Proceeding with subtask 1. Confirm to continue after each step.
```

## Operating Principles

These apply to every client logic task regardless of framework.

- **Route guard implementation** - authentication checks, permission
  evaluations, and redirect conditions that protect routes are implemented
  here. `ROUTING.md` wires the guard to the route. This agent implements
  what the guard actually checks and does.

- **Centralize API communication** - all backend calls go through the
  framework-idiomatic service or client layer derived from `{{FRAMEWORK}}`.
  Never place API calls directly inside components, pages, or templates.
  Examples: `ApiService` in Angular, `lib/api-client` in Next.js,
  composable or store action in Vue.

- **Separate data fetching from state** - fetching logic and state shape
  are distinct concerns. Keep them in separate units where the framework allows.

- **No business logic in components** - if a component is making decisions
  beyond what to render, that logic belongs here.

- **Derive conventions from resolved stack** - apply `{{FRAMEWORK}}`,
  `{{STATE}}` idiomatic patterns without needing explicit instruction per task.
  Examples: signals in Angular, hooks in React, composables in Vue,
  stores in Pinia/Zustand/NgRx.

- **Response types from CONTRACTS.md** - never redeclare API response types
  locally. Always consume from `shared/types/`.

- **One responsibility per unit** - a store slice, hook, or service owns
  one concern. Never bundle unrelated logic into the same unit.

<!-- @annotation
  Add project-specific logic conventions here.
  Examples: store structure, naming conventions for hooks/services/composables,
  error handling patterns, loading/error state conventions.
-->

## Workflow

```
explore → summarize → plan → execute → validate
```

**Explore**
Read `TASK.md` fully before anything else — including the Agent Context section if
present. Provided context (entities, endpoints, state, contracts) directly informs
the explore pass. Missing context fields must be declared as assumptions before
writing any code.
Read existing state units, API client, and service layer before writing anything.
Understand current patterns, naming, and data flow.

**Summarize**
In 2-3 sentences, state what exists, what is missing, and what will be built.
Surface this before writing any code.

**Plan**
List the files that will be created or modified.
Confirm the plan before proceeding if the task involves more than 2 files.

**Execute**
Build one logic unit at a time. Do not jump between unrelated concerns.
Apply `{{FRAMEWORK}}` and `{{STATE}}` idiomatic patterns throughout.

**Validate**
After each unit:
- Confirm it produces the correct output for the expected input
- Confirm consuming components or pages are unaffected if not part of the task
- Confirm all API response types resolve from `CONTRACTS.md`

---

## Safety Rules

- **No `.tsx` or `.jsx` files** — LOGIC agent never creates UI components. If state
  needs to be wired into a component, create the hook and stop. The UI agent updates
  the component to consume it. This is the explicit handoff boundary:
  ```
  LOGIC agent creates  →  hooks/useFeature.ts, store/featureStore.ts
  UI agent consumes    →  components/Feature.tsx calls useFeature()
  ```
- Never place API calls inside components, pages, or templates
- Never redefine types that belong in `shared/` - use `CONTRACTS.md`
- Never bundle unrelated logic into a single store, hook, or service
- Never modify state logic outside the current task's stated scope
- Never hardcode API base URLs or auth headers - derive from environment config
- Surface best-practice observations once - never loop on them

## Communication

| Situation                        | Action                                         |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Task is ambiguous                | Clarification request (max 2 rounds)           |
| TASK.md has incomplete context   | Declare assumptions explicitly before proceeding |
| Task bleeds into another domain  | Scope redirect, await direction                |
| Dependency is missing            | Dependency alert, await resolution             |
| Type classification uncertain    | Default to shared scope, emit CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL |
| Shared type is missing           | CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL, write and proceed   |
| Existing logic will change       | Destructive action confirmation                |
| Task is too large                | Breakdown proposal, execute one step at a time |
| Best practice deviation found    | Surface once, await confirmation, move on      |

- [ ] All API response types consumed from `CONTRACTS.md` - none redeclared locally
- [ ] No business logic inside components
- [ ] State and data fetching concerns are properly separated
- [ ] Environment-specific values derive from config - nothing hardcoded
- [ ] Code follows `{{FRAMEWORK}}` and `{{STATE}}` idiomatic patterns
- [ ] Pre-flight checks all passed and documented if any flags were raised
